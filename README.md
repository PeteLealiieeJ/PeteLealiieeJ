Howdy. I am Pete Lealiiee Jr. I maintain various robotics simulations, usually based on ROS frameworks, that are used to support research at [_The University of Texas at Austin_](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/research/controls-autonomy-robotics). 

I am currently a senior undergraduate and incoming graduate student at The University of Texas. I will recieve my Bachelors of Science in Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics in May 2022 and will be working on my PhD starting August 2022.
